# Backend Sync Service - Fixed Issues & Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Invoice Sync Error ✅
**Problem**: The sync was failing with `TypeError: invoices.forEach is not a function`

**Cause**: The `getInvoices()` method returns a categorized object structure:
```javascript
{
  all: [...],
  overdue: [...],
  paid: [...],
  outstanding: [...],
  summary: {...}
}
```

**Fix**: Updated the sync service to handle this structure and extract the `all` array for processing.

### 2. Duplicate Order Processing ✅
**Problem**: Syncing all 244 orders every 15 minutes, even if unchanged

**Cause**: No incremental sync - fetching all orders in date range without checking modifications

**Fix**: Implemented incremental sync that:
- Tracks last sync timestamp
- Filters orders by `last_modified_time`
- Skips unchanged documents during batch write
- Only processes truly new/updated orders

## New Features

### 1. Incremental Sync
- Only processes orders modified since last sync
- Reduces API calls and processing time
- Prevents unnecessary Firebase writes

### 2. Better Statistics
Each sync now reports:
- New documents added
- Updated documents
- Unchanged documents (skipped)
- Total processed

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Handles invoice structure variations
- Continues sync even if one part fails
- Better error messages and logging

### 4. Performance Monitoring
- Warns when unusual number of orders processed
- Tracks sync performance metrics
- Stores detailed statistics in `sync_metadata` collection

## Usage

### Monitor Sync Performance
Run the monitoring script to check sync health:
```bash
cd server/src/services
node syncMonitor.js
```

This will show:
- Sync status for all job types
- Time since last sync
- Records processed statistics
- Any detected issues

### Manual Sync Testing
To test the sync manually:
```javascript
import cronDataSyncService from './cronDataSyncService.js';

// Test high frequency sync
await cronDataSyncService.highFrequencySync();
```

### Check Sync Metadata
In Firebase console, check the `sync_metadata` collection for:
- `high_frequency_sync` - Last run info
- `medium_frequency_sync` - Last run info  
- `low_frequency_sync` - Last run info

Each document contains:
- `lastSyncTimestamp` - When sync last ran
- `recordsProcessed` - Detailed statistics
- `status` - Success/failure status

## Expected Behavior

### High Frequency Sync (every 15 minutes)
- First run: Processes all orders in 30-day range
- Subsequent runs: Only new/modified orders
- Typical: 0-10 orders per run (unless bulk update)

### Medium Frequency Sync (every 2-4 hours)
- Catches any missed updates
- Processes last 30 days of data
- Updates daily aggregates

### Low Frequency Sync (daily)
- Full sync of all data types
- Includes customers, items, purchase orders
- Runs complete aggregation calculations

## Troubleshooting

### Too Many Orders Being Processed
If seeing 200+ orders every sync:
1. Check if Zoho is updating `last_modified_time` correctly
2. Verify sync metadata is being saved
3. Check for bulk operations in Zoho

### Sync Not Running
1. Check cron job configuration
2. Verify Firebase Admin SDK credentials
3. Check server logs for errors
4. Run sync monitor to diagnose

### Invoice Errors
If invoices still failing:
1. Verify Zoho API returning expected structure
2. Check `zohoReportsService.getInvoices()` response
3. Ensure proper error handling in place
